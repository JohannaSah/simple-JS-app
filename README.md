This project is an exercise in building a small web app with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing
of data points in detail.

The goal is to have an app that allows users t view a list of data and see
more details for a given data item on demand.

For this project I chose the following public API:


The key features for this app are:
- load data from an external API
- view a list of items
- on user action, view details for that item

This app will work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.
